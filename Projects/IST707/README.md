## Description
In this project, we have done data analysis to analyze the factors which impact the readmission rates. We have created a correlation matrix to understand the relation between the numeric variables. We have also used the K-means clustering method to group similar objects together in a cluster. We have applied Association Rule Mining technique by applying the apriori algorithm to find the frequent pattern, correlation or causal structure from the dataset. We have applied different classification techniques like Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine and calculates the accuracy rate, error rate, and confusion matrix. To analyze text data, we have used SnowballC package is used for document stemming.Â

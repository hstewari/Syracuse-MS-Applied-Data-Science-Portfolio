## Description
In this project, we have done data preprocessing and data analysis to analyze Review Count per Company per Year, Review Count per Employee Type, Overall Rating per Employee Type, Average Stars per Company Heatmap, Word Cloud to show the Pros and Cons for each Company. We have used Supervised Learning, Textual Classification and Sentiment Analysis methods and applied Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machines models to analyze whether a model can learn from the data to correctly recognize the employee attitude based on pure textual information.
